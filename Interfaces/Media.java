/**some things you should know about the interfaces are they are just like to abstract class but the things they
 * allow us to create a multiple inheritance and the other and the important thing is hat the method or anything that we are going to create in the abstrcat classes are
 * always the abstract**/


/**some important thing that you should remember :
 *      interfaces are not like the class where you have some hierarchy
 *      you can use any class or any interface as a parent
 *      no subclass parent class concept is present here
 *      here two unrelated class can have the same interface
